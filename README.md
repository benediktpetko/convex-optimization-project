# convex-optimization-project
This template serves as a minimal setup for experimentation with classification tasks via EMD and dual Sinkhorn divergences.
The only two dependencies are scikit-learn and Python Optimal Transport packages.
To install these, ideally set up a virtual environment by pipenv or conda and run
```pip install sklearn POT```
in the terminal.
